I forgot why I originally created this repo, probably testing something at home, but I'm repurposing it as a reference guide that will be searchable through
tags for work bugs. We use this really obnoxious free version control software called BugNET and it doesn't have a good way for me to 
create a searchable error knowledge base for myself.

For anyone visiting this page on a lark, you're not going to find much on here that is probably applicable to anyone else, or shows my 
general programming achievements outside of work, haha. Just a heads up.
